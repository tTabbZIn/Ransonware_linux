# Ransonware_linux
A basic ransomware application for Linux, developed in Rust. I created it to gain a deeper understanding of how ransomware operates and to explore its mechanisms. The project has notable flaws and areas for improvement, and Iâ€™m actively working on enhancing it.
Use with caution; while it's simple, it can still be potentially dangerous.
